RCB - Report Creating Bot (Oct 2020 build)

The young minds love to explore, invent & do interesting things...!
Just let the computer take care of those repetitive tasks!
RCB is a robot that will automate the creation of your EXAMLY report!
Probably within 3 minutes or so, you can get a perfectly fine report!
Just fill in your examly login credentials & the TEST ANALYSIS LINK!
The link should be resembling either of these below formats...
https://psgtech.examly.io/result?id=
https://pat.psgtech.ac.in/result?id=
Works for both "pat.psgtech.ac.in" and "psgtech.examly.io" sites!

Sit back, leave your computer alone & witness the magic of RCB!
In the end, you can submit the robot generated docx file as your examly record!

Note - Your login credentials won't be recorded or copied in any form...
They are forgotten by the system once the job is done!
I truly respect & value your privacy very much...

Not much to elaborate on how to use the app... It's quite easy to use...
Even if you're new to this app, you can handle it perfectly okay!

Caution 1:
Please don't interact with the automated browser window!
If it slows down anywhere, kindly wait... It'll work fine...
Once the job is done, it will close itself... Don't worry...

Caution 2:
Just make sure you've got the following four things, else it won't work...
1) RCB app
2) Chromedriver (whose version should match your chrome browser)
3) Consolas.tff
4) heartRCB.ico
